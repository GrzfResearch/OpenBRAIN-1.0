INTRODUCTION

OpenBRAIN - OpenSees for Bridge Reliability Analysis In Networks is a 
Message Passage Interface (MPI) software designed for research purposes about 
the structural reliability of typical highway girder and adjacent boxes bridges
in a UNIX environment using the C++ programming lenguage. 
To operate, it requires the installation of the following third party libraries:

GNU Compiler Collection, gcc				https://gcc.gnu.org/
GNU Compiler Collection, gfortran			https://gcc.gnu.org/
GNU Scientific Library (GSL)				https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
OpenMPI - Open Source High Performance Computing 	https://www.open-mpi.org/
OpenSees Framework Libraries				http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/developer/svn.php

Documentation and installation procedures for the above libraries are not 
included in this package. The user should contact directly the developer 
of each library for assistance.

INSTALLATION

The software should be installed on computational machines running Linux OS
after the installation of the above dependencies using the MakefileMPI
provided with the package. The MakefileMPI to be modified substituing the
name "user directory" with the local path to the directories containing 
headers and dependent libraries respectively.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM

OpenBRAIN can run in the local folder where it is compiled using the shell
script "Input_Batch.sh" included within the package. The shell file contains 
a simple description of the input required by the program. 

The file generates an output that is directed to a text file "OUTPUT_NAME.dat"
if the operator ">" is included in the string, otherwise the output is sent to
the console screen.
  
The output file contains information about the section capacity of the bridge,
a sample of bridge responces fro each failure mode, and the reliability index
for each failure mode. The file "TestOutput.dat" contains the result of the 
analysis for the input string listed "Input_Batch.sh".

A more detailed manual of operation is currently under development and will be
uploaded to the repository soon.
